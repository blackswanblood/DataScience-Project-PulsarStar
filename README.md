# Identifying Pulsar Stars utilizing KNN classification model

### UBC dsci100 project

## About the course

UBC has offered a really nice course named dsci100. Although it is a brand new course targeting first-year student, the course material and syllabus are well designed. So it will
be a nice elective for all the students who are interested in data science. Instructors, Trevor and Melissa, are sophisticated and friendly. They have adapted a filpped class
paradigm where students, TAs and instructors can communicate interactively. They really know how to teach this course and you will be able to appreciate the beauty of **data 
manipulation, knn classification, knn & linear regression, k-means clustering and statistical inference (point estimation and bootstrapping)**. If you take this course, you tend
to grasp the basic syntax of language R and do some awesome visualization of the dataset. Evaluation of some particular approaches has also been specified (cross-validation to 
training set, testing set alone etc.). We have three quizzes, mulitple assignments and tutorials as well as instensive reading materials before each class.

Every topic in this course can be further developed and it is recommended to take future STAT courses after this course. 

*You will get an overview of data science and gain abundant transferable skills (cool machine learning skill lol~~)*.

## About the project

- Though the project is time-consuming and challenging, it is genuinely rewarding without doubts. You can learn a lot of R apart from those in the lecture and may feel desperate
when confronted with giant, raw, unlabelled dataset. Meanwhile, this project reinforces and hones your self-learning skills which are deemed important during the study in university. 

- There are specifications in the jupyter notebooks that I uploaded. Feel free to check out my project and point out any potential issue.
-  I hope you enjoy this course like I did *hahaha~~* (Except for the quizzes, they are **HARD**, p.s. maybe just for me).
